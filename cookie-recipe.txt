Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) unsalted butter, softened
1 cup sugar
1 large egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla

Directions:
Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl.
Beat together butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at 
medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes in a standing mixer. 

Beat in egg and vanilla. Reduce speed to low, 
then add flour mixture and mix until just combined.
Form dough into a 12-inch log (2 inches in diameter) on a 
sheet of plastic wrap and roll up dough in plastic wrap. 

Chill dough on a baking sheet until firm, at least 4 hours.
Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 375°F.
Cut enough 1/8- to 1/4-inch-thick slices from log with a heavy knife to fill 
2 ungreased large baking sheets, arranging slices about 1 inch apart. 

Bake cookies, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, 
until edges are golden, 12 to 15 minutes total.
